Port of the Recalcitrant Adventurer
    The port's gray sand complements its decaying look very well. Many
adventurers disembark here daily, attracted by the golden stories and
glory. There are also many fishermen and villagers coming from the local village to
exercising their professions or trying to extract some coin from the newcomers.
    Porto do Aventureiro Recalcitrant has been the gateway to all
kind of adventurous spirit in the Kingdom of Shambles. Certainly this vast
region doesn't deserve to be called the "kingdom" but it certainly deserves the nickname
demerit of "disorder" since it is truly a lawless land. At
True, it is officially called "vastness", and there are many here who
declare kings and princes, or any other title.
    These powers rule and dismantle in city-states or small regions
over which they manage to impose their authority. However, in the realm of
Turmoil nothing lasts, princes fall and rise day after day.
    The beach stretches from north to south, and to the east is the great sea by which
adventurers arrive. To the west there appears to be a customs house.
